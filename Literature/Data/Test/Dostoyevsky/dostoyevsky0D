I did not find him at home till past seven o'clock that evening. To my
surprise he had visitors with him--Alexey Nilitch, and another gentleman
I hardly knew, one Shigalov, the brother of Virginsky's wife.

This gentleman must, I think, have been staying about two months in
the town; I don't know where he came from. I had only heard that he
had written some sort of article in a progressive Petersburg magazine.
Virginsky had introduced me casually to him in the street. I had
never in my life seen in a man's face so much despondency, gloom, and
moroseness. He looked as though he were expecting the destruction of the
world, and not at some indefinite time in accordance with prophecies,
which might never be fulfilled, but quite definitely, as though it were
to be the day after to-morrow at twenty-five minutes past ten. We hardly
said a word to one another on that occasion, but had simply shaken hands
like two conspirators. I was most struck by his ears, which were of
unnatural size, long, broad, and thick, sticking out in a peculiar way.
His gestures were slow and awkward.

If Liputin had imagined that a phalanstery might be established in our
province, this gentleman certainly knew the day and the hour when it
would be founded. He made a sinister impression on me. I was the more
surprised at finding him here, as Shatov was not fond of visitors.

I could hear from the stairs that they were talking very loud, all three
at once, and I fancy they were disputing; but as soon as I went in, they
all ceased speaking. They were arguing, standing up, but now they all
suddenly sat down, so that I had to sit down too. There was a stupid
silence that was not broken for fully three minutes. Though Shigalov
knew me, he affected not to know me, probably not from hostile feelings,
but for no particular reason. Alexey Nilitch and I bowed to one another
in silence, and for some reason did not shake hands. Shigalov began at
last looking at me sternly and frowningly, with the most na√Øve assurance
that I should immediately get up and go away. At last Shatov got up from
his chair and the others jumped up at once. They went out without saying
good-bye. Shigalov only said in the doorway to Shatov, who was seeing
him out:

"Remember that you are bound to give an explanation."

"Hang your explanation, and who the devil am I bound to?" said Shatov.
He showed them out and fastened the door with the latch.

"Snipes!" he said, looking at me, with a sort of wry smile.

His face looked angry, and it seemed strange to me that he spoke first.
When I had been to see him before (which was not often) it had usually
happened that he sat scowling in a corner, answered ill-humouredly
and only completely thawed and began to talk with pleasure after a
considerable time. Even so, when he was saying good-bye he always
scowled, and let one out as though he were getting rid of a personal
enemy.

"I had tea yesterday with that Alexey Nilitch," I observed. "I think
he's mad on atheism."

"Russian atheism has never gone further than making a joke," growled
Shatov, putting up a new candle in place of an end that had burnt out.

"No, this one doesn't seem to me a joker, I think he doesn't know how to
talk, let alone trying to make jokes."

"Men made of paper! It all comes from flunkeyism of thought," Shatov
observed calmly, sitting down on a chair in the corner, and pressing the
palms of both hands on his knees.

"There's hatred in it, too," he went on, after a minute's pause.
"They'd be the first to be terribly unhappy if Russia could be suddenly
reformed, even to suit their own ideas, and became extraordinarily
prosperous and happy. They'd have no one to hate then, no one to curse,
nothing to find fault with. There is nothing in it but an immense animal
hatred for Russia which has eaten into their organism.... And it isn't
a case of tears unseen by the world under cover of a smile! There has
never been a falser word said in Russia than about those unseen tears,"
he cried, almost with fury.

"Goodness only knows what you're saying," I laughed.

"Oh, you're a 'moderate liberal,'" said Shatov, smiling too. "Do you
know," he went on suddenly, "I may have been talking nonsense about the
'flunkeyism of thought.' You will say to me no doubt directly, 'it's you
who are the son of a flunkey, but I'm not a flunkey.'"

"I wasn't dreaming of such a thing.... What are you saying!"

"You need not apologise. I'm not afraid of you. Once I was only the
son of a flunkey, but now I've become a flunkey myself, like you. Our
Russian liberal is a flunkey before everything, and is only looking for
some one whose boots he can clean."

"What boots? What allegory is this?"

"Allegory, indeed! You are laughing, I see.... Stepan Trofimovitch said
truly that I lie under a stone, crushed but not killed, and do nothing
but wriggle. It was a good comparison of his."

"Stepan Trofimovitch declares that you are mad over the Germans," I
laughed. "We've borrowed something from them anyway."

"We took twenty kopecks, but we gave up a hundred roubles of our own."

We were silent a minute.

"He got that sore lying in America."

"Who? What sore?"

"I mean Kirillov. I spent four months with him lying on the floor of a
hut."
