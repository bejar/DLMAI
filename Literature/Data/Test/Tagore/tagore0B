Jotin sighed and said: 'We cannot leave behind us what is really worth
giving.'

'It's no trifle you are giving, dearest. I only pray she may have the
power to know the value of what is given her.'

'Give me a little more of that pomegranate juice, Mashi, I'm thirsty.
Did Mani come to me yesterday, I wonder?'

'Yes, she came, but you were asleep. She sat by your head, fanning
you for a long time, and then went away to get your clothes washed.'

'How wonderful! I believe I was dreaming that very moment that Mani
was trying to enter my room. The door was slightly open, and she was
pushing against it, but it wouldn't open. But, Mashi, you're going too
far,--you ought to let her see that I am dying; otherwise my death will
be a terrible shock to her.'

'Baba, let me put this shawl over your feet; they are getting cold.'

'No, Mashi, I can't bear anything over me like that.'

'Do you know, Jotin, Mani made this shawl for you? When she ought to
have been asleep, she was busy at it. It was finished only yesterday.'

Jotin took the shawl, and touched it tenderly with his hands. It
seemed to him that the softness of the wool was Mani's own. Her loving
thoughts had been woven night after night with its threads. It was
not made merely of wool, but also of her touch. Therefore, when Mashi
drew that shawl over his feet, it seemed as if, night after night,
Mani had been caressing his tired limbs.

'But, Mashi, I thought Mani didn't know how to knit,--at any rate she
never liked it.'

'It doesn't take long to learn a thing. Of course I had to teach her.
Then there are a good many mistakes in it.'

'Let there be mistakes; we're not going to send it to the Paris
Exhibition. It will keep my feet warm in spite of its mistakes.'

Jotin's mind began to picture Mani at her task, blundering and
struggling, and yet patiently going on night after night. How sweetly
pathetic it was! And again he went over the shawl with his caressing
fingers.

'Mashi, is the doctor downstairs?'

'Yes, he will stay here to-night.'

'But tell him it is useless for him to give me a sleeping draught. It
doesn't bring me real rest and only adds to my pain. Let me remain
properly awake. Do you know, Mashi, that my wedding took place on the
night of the full moon in the month of _Baisakh_? To-morrow will be
that day, and the stars of that very night will be shining in the
sky. Mani perhaps has forgotten. I want to remind her of it to-day;
just call her to me for a minute or two.... Why do you keep silent?
I suppose the doctor has told you I am so weak that any excitement
will----but I tell you truly, Mashi, to-night, if I can have only a
few minutes' talk with her, there will be no need for any sleeping
draughts. Mashi, don't cry like that! I am quite well. To-day my heart
is full as it has never been in my life before. That's why I want
to see Mani. No, no, Mashi, I can't bear to see you crying! You have
been so quiet all these last days. Why are you so troubled to-night?'
