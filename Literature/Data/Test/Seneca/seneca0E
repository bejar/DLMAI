III. The Lacedaemonians forbid their young men to contend in the
pancratium, or with the caestus, in which games the defeated party has
to acknowledge himself beaten. The winner of a race is he who first
reaches the goal; he outstrips the others in swiftness, but not in
courage. The wrestler who has been thrown three times loses the palm of
victory, but does not yield it up. Since the Lacedaemonians thought it
of great importance that their countrymen should be invincible, they
kept them away from those contests in which victory is assigned, not by
the judge, or by the issue of the contest itself, but by the voice
of the vanquished begging the victor to spare him as he falls. This
attribute of never being conquered, which they so jealously guard among
their citizens, can be attained by all men through virtue and goodwill,
because even when all else is vanquished, the mind remains unconquered.
For this cause no one speaks of the three hundred Fabii as conquered,
but slaughtered. Regulus was taken captive by the Carthaginians, not
conquered; and so were all other men who have not yielded in spirit when
overwhelmed by the strength and weight of angry fortune.

So is it with benefits. A man may have received more than he gave, more
valuable ones, more frequently bestowed; yet is he not vanquished. It
may be that, if you compare the benefits with one another, those which
he has received will outweigh those which he has bestowed; but if you
compare the giver and the receiver, whose intentions also ought to be
considered apart, neither will prove the victor. It often happens that
even when one combatant is pierced with many wounds, while the other is
only slightly injured, yet they are said to have fought a drawn battle,
although the former may appear to be the worse man.

IV. No one, therefore, can be conquered in a contest of benefits, if he
knows how to owe a debt, if he wishes to make a return for what he
has received, and raises himself to the same level with his friend in
spirit, though he cannot do so in material gifts. As long as he remains
in this temper of mind, as long as he has the wish to declare by proofs
that he has a grateful mind, what difference does it make upon which
side we can count the greater number of presents? You are able to give
much; I can do nothing but receive. Fortune abides with you, goodwill
alone with me; yet I am as much on an equality with you as naked or
lightly armed men are with a large body armed to the teeth. No one,
therefore, is worsted by benefits, because each man's gratitude is to be
measured by his will. If it be disgraceful to be worsted in a contest
of benefits, you ought not to receive a benefit from very powerful men
whose kindness you cannot return, I mean such as princes and kings, whom
fortune has placed in such a station that they can give away much, and
can only receive very little and quite inadequate returns for what they
give. I have spoken of kings and princes, who alone can cause works to
be accomplished, and whose superlative power depends upon the obedience
and services of inferiors; but some there are, free from all earthly
lusts, who are scarcely affected by any human objects of desire, upon
whom fortune herself could bestow nothing. I must be worsted in a
contest of benefits with Socrates, or with Diogenes, who walked naked
through the treasures of Macedonia, treading the king's wealth under his
feet. In good sooth, he must then rightly have seemed, both to himself
and to all others whose eyes were keen enough to perceive the real
truth, to be superior even to him at whose feet all the world lay.
He was far more powerful, far richer even than Alexander, who then
possessed everything; for there was more that Diogenes could refuse to
receive than that Alexander was able to give.

V. It is not disgraceful to be worsted by these men, for I am not the
less brave because you pit me against an invulnerable enemy, nor does
fire not burn because you throw into it something over which flames have
no power, nor does iron lose its power of cutting, though you may wish
to cut up a stone which is hard, impervious to blows, and of such a
nature that hard tools are blunted upon it. I give you the same answer
about gratitude. A man is not disgracefully worsted in a contest of
benefits if he lays himself under an obligation to such persons
as these, whose enormous wealth or admirable virtue shut out all
possibility of their benefits being returned. As a rule we are worsted
by our parents; for while we have them with us, we regard them as
severe, and do not understand what they do for us. When our age begins
to bring us a little sense, and we gradually perceive that they deserve
our love for those very things which used to prevent our loving them,
their advice, their punishments, and the careful watch which they used
to keep over our youthful recklessness, they are taken from us. Few live
to reap any real fruit from children; most men feel their sons only as
a burden. Yet there is no disgrace in being worsted by one's parent
in bestowing benefits; how should there be, seeing that there is no
disgrace in being worsted by anyone. We are equal to some men, and yet
not equal; equal in intention, which is all that they care for, which
is all that we promise to be, but unequal in fortune. And if fortune
prevents any one from repaying a kindness, he need not, therefore,
blush, as though he were vanquished; there is no disgrace in failing
to reach your object, provided you attempt to reach it. It often is
necessary, that before making any return for the benefits which we have
received, we should ask for new ones; yet, if so, we shall not refrain
from asking for them, nor shall we do so as though disgraced by so
doing, because, even if we do not repay the debt, we shall owe it;
because, even if something from without befalls us to prevent our
repaying it, it will not be our fault if we are not grateful. We can
neither be conquered in intention, nor can we be disgraced by yielding
to what is beyond our strength to contend with.
