Two weeks out, they encountered by night a frigate-like craft, supposed to be an enemy.  The vessels came within hail, both showing English colors, with purposes of mutual deception, affecting to belong to the English Navy.  For an hour, through their speaking trumpets, the captains equivocally conversed.  A very reserved, adroit, hoodwinking, statesman-like conversation, indeed.  At last, professing some little incredulity as to the truthfulness of the stranger’s statement, Paul intimated a desire that he should put out a boat and come on board to show his commission, to which the stranger very affably replied, that unfortunately his boat was exceedingly leaky.  With equal politeness, Paul begged him to consider the danger attending a refusal, which rejoinder nettled the other, who suddenly retorted that he would answer for twenty guns, and that both himself and men were knock-down Englishmen.  Upon this, Paul said that he would allow him exactly five minutes for a sober, second thought.  That brief period passed, Paul, hoisting the American colors, ran close under the other ship’s stern, and engaged her.  It was about eight o’clock at night that this strange quarrel was picked in the middle of the ocean.  Why cannot men be peaceable on that great common?  Or does nature in those fierce night-brawlers, the billows, set mankind but a sorry example?
After ten minutes’ cannonading, the stranger struck, shouting out that half his men were killed.  The Ariel’s crew hurrahed.  Boarders were called to take possession.  At this juncture, the prize shifting her position so that she headed away, and to leeward of the Ariel, thrust her long spanker-boom diagonally over the latter’s quarter; when Israel, who was standing close by, instinctively caught hold of it—­just as he had grasped the jib-boom of the Serapis—­and, at the same moment, hearing the call to take possession, in the valiant excitement of the occasion, he leaped upon the spar, and made a rush for the stranger’s deck, thinking, of course, that he would be immediately followed by the regular boarders.  But the sails of the strange ship suddenly filled; she began to glide through the sea; her spanker-boom, not having at all entangled itself, offering no hindrance.  Israel, clinging midway along the boom, soon found himself divided from the Ariel by a space impossible to be leaped.  Meantime, suspecting foul play, Paul set every sail; but the stranger, having already the advantage, contrived to make good her escape, though perseveringly chased by the cheated conqueror.
In the confusion, no eye had observed our hero’s spring.  But, as the vessels separated more, an officer of the strange ship spying a man on the boom, and taking him for one of his own men, demanded what he did there.
“Clearing the signal halyards, sir,” replied Israel, fumbling with the cord which happened to be dangling near by.
“Well, bear a hand and come in, or you will have a bow-chaser at you soon,” referring to the bow guns of the Ariel.
“Aye, aye, sir,” said Israel, and in a moment he sprang to the deck, and soon found himself mixed in among some two hundred English sailors of a large letter of marque.  At once he perceived that the story of half the crew being killed was a mere hoax, played off for the sake of making an escape.  Orders were continually being given to pull on this and that rope, as the ship crowded all sail in flight.  To these orders Israel, with the rest, promptly responded, pulling at the rigging stoutly as the best of them; though Heaven knows his heart sunk deeper and deeper at every pull which thus helped once again to widen the gulf between him and home.
In intervals he considered with himself what to do.  Favored by the obscurity of the night and the number of the crew, and wearing much the same dress as theirs, it was very easy to pass himself off for one of them till morning.  But daylight would be sure to expose him, unless some cunning, plan could be hit upon.  If discovered for what he was, nothing short of a prison awaited him upon the ship’s arrival in port.
It was a desperate case, only as desperate a remedy could serve.  One thing was sure, he could not hide.  Some audacious parade of himself promised the only hope.  Marking that the sailors, not being of the regular navy, wore no uniform, and perceiving that his jacket was the only garment on him which bore any distinguishing badge, our adventurer took it off, and privily dropped it overboard, remaining now in his dark blue woollen shirt and blue cloth waistcoat.
What the more inspirited Israel to the added step now contemplated, was the circumstance that the ship was not a Frenchman’s or other foreigner, but her crew, though enemies, spoke the same language that he did.
So very quietly, at last, he goes aloft into the maintop, and sitting down on an old sail there, beside some eight or ten topmen, in an off-handed way asks one for tobacco.
“Give us a quid, lad,” as he settled himself in his seat.
“Halloo,” said the strange sailor, “who be you?  Get out of the top!  The fore and mizzentop men won’t let us go into their tops, and blame me if we’ll let any of their gangs come here.  So, away ye go.”
“You’re blind, or crazy, old boy,” rejoined Israel.  “I’m a topmate; ain’t I, lads?” appealing to the rest.
“There’s only ten maintopmen belonging to our watch; if you are one, then there’ll be eleven,” said a second sailor.  “Get out of the top!”
“This is too bad, maties,” cried Israel, “to serve an old topmate this way.  Come, come, you are foolish.  Give us a quid.”  And, once more, with the utmost sociability, he addressed the sailor next to him.
“Look ye,” returned the other, “if you don’t make away with yourself, you skulking spy from the mizzen, we’ll drop you to deck like a jewel-block.”
Seeing the party thus resolute, Israel, with some affected banter, descended.
The reason why he had tried the scheme—­and, spite of the foregoing failure, meant to repeat it—­was this:  As customary in armed ships, the men were in companies allotted to particular places and functions.  Therefore, to escape final detection, Israel must some way get himself recognized as belonging to some one of those bands; otherwise, as an isolated nondescript, discovery ere long would be certain, especially upon the next general muster.  To be sure, the hope in question was a forlorn sort of hope, but it was his sole one, and must therefore be tried.
Mixing in again for a while with the general watch, he at last goes on the forecastle among the sheet-anchor-men there, at present engaged in critically discussing the merits of the late valiant encounter, and expressing their opinion that by daybreak the enemy in chase would be hull-down out of sight.
“To be sure she will,” cried Israel, joining in with the group, “old ballyhoo that she is, to be sure.  But didn’t we pepper her, lads?  Give us a chew of tobacco, one of ye.  How many have we wounded, do ye know?  None killed that I’ve heard of.  Wasn’t that a fine hoax we played on ’em?  Ha! ha!  But give us a chew.”
In the prodigal fraternal patriotism of the moment, one of the old worthies freely handed his plug to our adventurer, who, helping himself, returned it, repeating the question as to the killed and wounded.
“Why,” said he of the plug, “Jack Jewboy told me, just now, that there’s only seven men been carried down to the surgeon, but not a soul killed.”
“Good, boys, good!” cried Israel, moving up to one of the gun-carriages, where three or four men were sitting—­“slip along, chaps, slip along, and give a watchmate a seat with ye.”
“All full here, lad; try the next gun.”
