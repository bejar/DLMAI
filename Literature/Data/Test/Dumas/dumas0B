"What blockheads they are!"

"But, indeed, they reproach us with it."

"And yet, if these negotiations had been successful, they would have
prevented the defeats of Rees, Orsay, Wesel, and Rheinberg; the Rhine
would not have been crossed, and Holland might still consider herself
invincible in the midst of her marshes and canals."

"All this is quite true, my dear Cornelius, but still more certain
it is, that if at this moment our correspondence with the Marquis de
Louvois were discovered, skilful pilot as I am, I should not be able to
save the frail barque which is to carry the brothers De Witt and their
fortunes out of Holland. That correspondence, which might prove to
honest people how dearly I love my country, and what sacrifices I have
offered to make for its liberty and glory, would be ruin to us if it
fell into the hands of the Orange party. I hope you have burned the
letters before you left Dort to join me at the Hague."

"My dear brother," Cornelius answered, "your correspondence with M. de
Louvois affords ample proof of your having been of late the greatest,
most generous, and most able citizen of the Seven United Provinces. I
rejoice in the glory of my country; and particularly do I rejoice
in your glory, John. I have taken good care not to burn that
correspondence."

"Then we are lost, as far as this life is concerned," quietly said the
Grand Pensionary, approaching the window.

"No, on the contrary, John, we shall at the same time save our lives and
regain our popularity."

"But what have you done with these letters?"

"I have intrusted them to the care of Cornelius van Baerle, my godson,
whom you know, and who lives at Dort."

"Poor honest Van Baerle! who knows so much, and yet thinks of nothing
but of flowers and of God who made them. You have intrusted him with
this fatal secret; it will be his ruin, poor soul!"

"His ruin?"

"Yes, for he will either be strong or he will be weak. If he is
strong, he will, when he hears of what has happened to us, boast of
our acquaintance; if he is weak, he will be afraid on account of his
connection with us: if he is strong, he will betray the secret by his
boldness; if he is weak, he will allow it to be forced from him. In
either case he is lost, and so are we. Let us, therefore, fly, fly, as
long as there is still time."

Cornelius de Witt, raising himself on his couch, and grasping the
hand of his brother, who shuddered at the touch of his linen bandages,
replied,--

"Do not I know my godson? have not I been enabled to read every thought
in Van Baerle's mind, and every sentiment in his heart? You ask whether
he is strong or weak. He is neither the one nor the other; but that is
not now the question. The principal point is, that he is sure not to
divulge the secret, for the very good reason that he does not know it
himself."

John turned round in surprise.

"You must know, my dear brother, that I have been trained in the school
of that distinguished politician John de Witt; and I repeat to you,
that Van Baerle is not aware of the nature and importance of the deposit
which I have intrusted to him."

"Quick then," cried John, "as there is still time, let us convey to him
directions to burn the parcel."

"Through whom?"

"Through my servant Craeke, who was to have accompanied us on horseback,
and who has entered the prison with me, to assist you downstairs."

"Consider well before having those precious documents burnt, John!"

"I consider, above all things, that the brothers De Witt must
necessarily save their lives, to be able to save their character. If
we are dead, who will defend us? Who will have fully understood our
intentions?"

"You expect, then, that they would kill us if those papers were found?"

John, without answering, pointed with his hand to the square, whence, at
that very moment, fierce shouts and savage yells made themselves heard.

"Yes, yes," said Cornelius, "I hear these shouts very plainly, but what
is their meaning?"

John opened the window.

"Death to the traitors!" howled the populace.

"Do you hear now, Cornelius?"

"To the traitors! that means us!" said the prisoner, raising his eyes to
heaven and shrugging his shoulders.

"Yes, it means us," repeated John.

"Where is Craeke?"

"At the door of your cell, I suppose."

"Let him enter then."

John opened the door; the faithful servant was waiting on the threshold.

"Come in, Craeke, and mind well what my brother will tell you."

"No, John; it will not suffice to send a verbal message; unfortunately,
I shall be obliged to write."

"And why that?"

"Because Van Baerle will neither give up the parcel nor burn it without
a special command to do so."

"But will you be able to write, poor old fellow?" John asked, with a
look on the scorched and bruised hands of the unfortunate sufferer.

"If I had pen and ink you would soon see," said Cornelius.

"Here is a pencil, at any rate."

"Have you any paper? for they have left me nothing."

"Here, take this Bible, and tear out the fly-leaf."

"Very well, that will do."

"But your writing will be illegible."

"Just leave me alone for that," said Cornelius. "The executioners have
indeed pinched me badly enough, but my hand will not tremble once in
tracing the few lines which are requisite."

And really Cornelius took the pencil and began to write, when through
the white linen bandages drops of blood oozed out which the pressure of
the fingers against the pencil squeezed from the raw flesh.

A cold sweat stood on the brow of the Grand Pensionary.

Cornelius wrote:--

"My dear Godson,--

"Burn the parcel which I have intrusted to you. Burn it without looking
at it, and without opening it, so that its contents may for ever remain
unknown to yourself. Secrets of this description are death to those
with whom they are deposited. Burn it, and you will have saved John and
Cornelius de Witt.

"Farewell, and love me.

"Cornelius de Witt

"August 20th, 1672."

John, with tears in his eyes, wiped off a drop of the noble blood which
had soiled the leaf, and, after having handed the despatch to Craeke
with a last direction, returned to Cornelius, who seemed overcome by
intense pain, and near fainting.

"Now," said he, "when honest Craeke sounds his coxswain's whistle, it
will be a signal of his being clear of the crowd, and of his having
reached the other side of the pond. And then it will be our turn to
depart."

Five minutes had not elapsed, before a long and shrill whistle was heard
through the din and noise of the square of the Buytenhof.

John gratefully raised his eyes to heaven.

"And now," said he, "let us off, Cornelius."
